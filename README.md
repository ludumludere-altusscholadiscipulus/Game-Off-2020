# Game-Off-2020
This is the repository for a game jam, Game Off 2020. I use Construct 3 to make the game, so all assets and code are inside that one file. You need to use Construct 3 to open it. Although the events and layers are over the limit for the free version of Construct 3, you can still open and play it. However, editing or adding more events would be impossible.
