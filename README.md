# Game-Off-2020
This is the repository for a game jam, Game Off 2020, with the theme called Moonshot. I use Construct 3 to make the game, so all assets and code are inside that one file. You need to use Construct 3 to open it. Although the events and layers are over the limit for the free version of Construct 3, you can still open and play it. However, editing or adding more events would be impossible.

Your dad, an astronaut, had been residing in the moon to help NASA in a certain project. You last saw him 3 months ago and wondered how is he and when he will come back. You wanted to write him a letter to tell him everything how you miss him, how your mom is doing, how the house is lonely without him, and stuff like that. You know that there are no such thing as a mailman astronaut and you were really desperate to see him. So, how do you solve this problem? YOU BUILD A ROCKET TO SEND IT TO THE MOON!

The source file is the Game Off 2020.c3p. Inside, you can see all assets, code, and design layout. You have to use Construct 3 to open it and no, you can't open it with Construct 2. If you're on the free version of Construct 3, it is impossible to add/edit events as it breaks the limit for the Construct 3 free version event limits. However, you can copy and paste the events from the c3p file to another project as long as the assets are also copied too. I know this is ridiculously confusing, but that's how Construct 3 works.
